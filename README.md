# Benford-s-Law

## Preface
S, I was watching Netflix documentary series called **Connected** and in one of episode, narrator talked about technique, which a lot of world's tax agencies use to check if company is commiting tax fraud. This technique is called Benford's Law.

## What is Benford's Law?
Many people guess that the odds are no different 
from it being any other number, so they say 10%. While there are 10 
digits, 0 can't be the leftmost digit of a population. So, there are 
actually only 9 choices.

OK, so the odds are 1 in 9, or a probability of about 11.1%‚Äù, you might
 say. Surprisingly, the odds of the first digit of a randomly-chosen 
population, or a number representing just about any other naturally 
occurring quantity, being a 1 is more than 30%!

This very counter-intuitive observation is known as Benford's Law.

## Project

**Fields:**

* Politics
* Sports
